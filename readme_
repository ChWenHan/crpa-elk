try crpau.

Work flow is:


0. do ground calc.

1. generate zrhokq= 
  the matrix of <ψ_{k+q,n,σ}|exp(-i·(q+G)·r))|ψ_{k,n',σ'}>
  see genzrhokq.f90

2. init wanprj vars. 
  see initwanprj_globalvars.f90 &
    modwanprj

3. generate the potential 
  (
    controled by potmode
    full pot W : potmode=2
    or sub pot U :potmode=1
    or static pot V( the 4pi/|q+G|^2) potmode=0 )
  for potmode=2; you can run task 120 and task 180
  .These tasks are original elk subroutines, so should be %100 right
    see 
    genpolsub.f90, 
    genepsinvrest.f90,
    genwrest.f90

4.  generated wanrhokq, (M_m,m',k,q,G quantity in appendix A of amadon paper.)
    see genwanrhokq_matop.f90. 
    The wannier projectors are generated on the fly
    see 
    wanprojkpl.f90

5. calc umat for each qpoint. eq A2 in amadon's paper.
   see genumatq.f90
 
6. tasks are :
    651: wantest; test wanprojkpl.f90 for k in non-red-k and k+q
    652: writewanrho; generate the projected zrhokq---- the Σ_k wkptnr * M_m,m',k,q,G quantity .Output as :MMMQ_K_000000_IQ000001.OUT
    653: generate the potential, controled by block :potmode. For full-intercation, you should use task120 and task 180.
    654: generate the projected pot.

Notice:
 1. the prefactor is omega*Ha_ev. Comparing with the prefac of gwsefmk.f90. They should be same.
 2. the wannier projector are generated for each non-reduced k-vec 
    and k+q vec.
    Thus the symmetry in wannier is not consisdered.
    That should be just a increase of the computation
  3. The generated 
  4. task 651 can be used for test wanprojkpl.f90
     task 652 will give you the wanrhokq
     task 653 is for potential calc
     task 654 is about doing the projection

problems:
  1. Problem is the value of static point of w=0  too high.
    for both u, w, and 
    V(which is strange for v, it may indicate that the prefac or
      the projection value are wrong.)
  2. not mpi parra
  3. not specify atoms, so just test for single atom systems.
